# Next.js

#### What is Next.js? and why would we use it?

Next.js calls itself a **React Framework for Production** and that name makes alot of sense, but what that really means.

**"Next.js offers alot of features that make building large scale production ready, React apps easier."**

Where React is a library and focused on building user interfaces and in the end, it's all client side javascript.

Next.js is a Framework built on React, It offers alot more than building user-interfaces which we have to add our own otherwise, like routing and other third party libraries. Out of the Box!

### Key Features of Next.js

#### 1. Server Side Rendering

Next.js supports server side rendering out of the box, Server Side Rendering is all about preparing the content of the page on the server instead on the client. It automatically pre-renders the content without any extra setup form our side. By Default. Out of the Box.

#### 2. File based routing

We don't even get a routing system with react. We have to install a third party library for routing, that's not it. The route we setup in react is in our code.

Next.js gets rid of that in-code route definition, Instead with Next.js we get file based routing system.We define our pages and routes with files and folders.

#### 3. Fullstack Capabilities

We can add some code which can work with filesystem or reaches out to database. We can have some standalone database related code with Next.js

With Next.js, It's very easy to add our own Backend API to our react project using Node JS code.

## Creating a new Next.js app

Make sure to have Node js Installed on the system and then run the following command:

```shell
npx create-next-app
```
